            <h2>What are the concerns of privacy online?</h2>
            <p>It is important to know the dangers of privacy online. For example, surprisingly many people are not
                aware
                they do not own the data that they input online. They are not aware that it is collected, sold to third
                parties, and used for targeted advertising. It matters that people should be educated about this, so
                those
                not aware can learn. Many people just click “I agree” the terms and service on a website, without
                reading
                them and knowing the full consequences. The everyday user is not aware what terms like “targeted
                advertising
                and “data mining” mean. That is what this website is there to fix. The goal is to educate people, so
                they
                are more aware online.

            <h2>What is "Data mining" and "targeted advertising"?</h2>
            <p>Data mining is the technique of gathering large amounts of information on someone, then typically, using
                this information along with machine learning, to create a pattern, to make a prediction. This prediction
                comes into play with “Targeted advertising”. Targeted advertising is when a company, or a website uses
                the prediction they made using machine learning to show ads that a user will most likely click on. There
                are four main ways ways of doing this. This website does not get into them, but you can find more
                information <a href="https://www.adpushup.com/blog/types-of-ad-targeting/"><span
                        class="link">here</span></a>. Peope often see
                targeted advertising in everday life.
                can see this often in everyday life. This is explained perfectly by a reputable teacher whose curriculum
                covers this. She said:</p>
            <p class="quote">"I'll be looking online for an item and then, boom,<br> that item will show up in my
                Facebook

        <h2 class="about">About</h2>
        <p>My name is Xander. For school I was assigned to do a project on what interested me. I was not sure, though
            after a little bit of digging I ran across Privacy Online. It interested me because I had no idea about it,
            nor did anyone else I talked to. I relized that was a probolom, and thus my project was born. I decided I
            would try to help educate people on just a small portion of it, but make a diffrence some way. </p>
